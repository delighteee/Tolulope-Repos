# Alt-School-Exam

In this template, I created a new vue js application using the GitHub API, fetched my GitHub repositories using this endpoint https://api.github.com/users/{{USERNAME}}/repos. Showed a page with a list of all my repositories on GitHub(the page has some form of pagination). Then I created another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the list of repos using nested routes. I made sure I implemented a wildcard route to catch 404 pages.
