    <p>
      I'm a product designer with 4+ years of experience in
      designing both consumer and enterprise products. I have extensive
      knowledge of UX best practices from the ground up. In addition to being a
      product designer, I’ve had training in product management, and front-end
      development. This enables me to understand, communicate and make
      insightful decisions/contributions to defining the 'what' as well as the
      'how'. I thrive best in helping to define the requirements, not just
      translating them into designs.

      When I'm not looking for ways to better my users' experiences, I'm either
      reading, trying out a new recipe, watching a movie, listening to a
      podcast, spending time with family. I also have experience working on
      front-end development projects which have allowed me to develop a holistic
      view of the product lifecycle, as well as what goes into creating a
      successful product (e.g., UX, UI, design, front-end development).
